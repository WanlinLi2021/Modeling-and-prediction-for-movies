## Part 1: Data
The data set comprises 651 randomly sampled movies produced and released before 2016. It includes information from Rotten Tomatoes and IMDB for a random sample of films. Because of this generalizability, we can make the correlation statements from this data set. Since the random assignment was not used, we cannot make a causation conclusion from this data set.

## Part 2: Research question
Is there a linear association between the audience score on Rotten Tomatoes and the characteristics of movies, critics' opinions, nominations, or awards of Oscar?

Reason: 1. audiences' opinion is significant for the development of movies.
        2. It's interesting to know whether there is an association between the audience score and Oscar awards.
        3. The critics are a particular audience group, whether their opinion is associated with other audiences' opinions.
        4. The results of this research will provide investors with references in choosing movie genres, actors, directors, etc.
